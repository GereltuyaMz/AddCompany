## Getting Started

*(Assuming you've [installed Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/installation))*

``` bash
composer install
```

Run the following command to generate your app key:

```
php artisan key:generate
```

Then start your server:

```
php artisan serve
```

Your Laravel starter project is now up and running!
